It works exactly the same as it\n * would on a native app using `UINavigationController`, providing the same\n * animations and behavior from UIKit.\n *\n * As the name implies, it is only available on iOS. Take a look at\n * [`React Navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/) for a cross-platform\n * solution in JavaScript, or check out either of these components for native\n * solutions: [native-navigation](http://airbnb.io/native-navigation/),\n * [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).\n *\n * To set up the navigator, provide the `initialRoute` prop with a route\n * object. A route object is used to describe each scene that your app\n * navigates to. `initialRoute` represents the first route in your navigator.\n *\n * ```\n * import PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { NavigatorIOS, Text } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <NavigatorIOS\n *         initialRoute={{\n *           component: MyScene,\n *           title: 'My Initial Scene',\n *         }}\n *         style={{flex: 1}}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * class MyScene extends Component {\n *   static propTypes = {\n *     title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n *     navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n *   }\n *\n *   _onForward = () => {\n *     this.props.navigator.push({\n *       title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <View>\n *         <Text>Current Scene: { this.props.title }</Text>\n *         <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}>\n *           <Text>Tap me to load the next scene</Text>\n *         </TouchableHighlight>\n *       </View>\n *     )\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In this code, the navigator renders the component specified in initialRoute,\n * which in this case is `MyScene`. This component will receive a `route` prop\n * and a `navigator` prop representing the navigator. The navigator's navigation\n * bar will render the title for the current scene, \"My Initial Scene\".\n *\n * You can optionally pass in a `passProps` property to your `initialRoute`.\n * `NavigatorIOS` passes this in as props to the rendered component:\n *\n * ```\n * initialRoute={{\n *   component: MyScene,\n *   title: 'My Initial Scene',\n *   passProps: { myProp: 'foo' }\n * }}\n * ```\n *\n * You can then access the props passed in via `{this.props.myProp}`.\n *\n * #### Handling Navigation\n *\n * To trigger navigation functionality such as pushing or popping a view, you\n * have access to a `navigator` object. The object is passed in as a prop to any\n * component that is rendered by `NavigatorIOS`. You can then call the\n * relevant methods to perform the navigation action you need:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyView extends Component {\n *   _handleBackPress() {\n *     this.props.navigator.pop();\n *   }\n *\n *   _handleNextPress(nextRoute) {\n *     this.props.navigator.push(nextRoute);\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     const nextRoute = {\n *       component: MyView,\n *       title: 'Bar That',\n *       passProps: { myProp: 'bar' }\n *     };\n *     return(\n *       <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => this._handleNextPress(nextRoute)}>\n *         <Text style={{marginTop: 200, alignSelf: 'center'}}>\n *           See you on the other nav {this.props.myProp}!\n *         </Text>\n *       </TouchableHighlight>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You can also trigger navigator functionality from the `NavigatorIOS`\n * component:\n *\n * ```\n * class NavvyIOS extends Component {\n *   _handleNavigationRequest() {\n *     this.refs.nav.push({\n *       component: MyView,\n *       title: 'Genius',\n *       passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <NavigatorIOS\n *         ref='nav'\n *         initialRoute={{\n *           component: MyView,\n *           title: 'Foo This',\n *           passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n *           rightButtonTitle: 'Add',\n *           onRightButtonPress: () => this._handleNavigationRequest(),\n *         }}\n *         style={{flex: 1}}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The code above adds a `_handleNavigationRequest` private method that is\n * invoked from the `NavigatorIOS` component when the right navigation bar item\n * is pressed.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nconst IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\ntype State = {\n    isTouching: boolean,\n    lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number,\n    lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number,\n    observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean,\n    becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean,\n};\ntype Event = Object;\n\nfunction isTagInstanceOfTextInput(tag) {\n  const instance = getInstanceFromNode(tag);\n  return instance && instance.viewConfig && (\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'AndroidTextInput' ||\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'RCTMultilineTextInputView' ||\n    instance.viewConfig.uiViewClassName === 'RCTSinglelineTextInputView'\n  );\n}\n\nconst ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function(): State {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable = {true}\n *         maxLength = {40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline = {true}\n *          numberOfLines = {4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border\n * has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it\n * cannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this is to either not set height\n * explicitly, case in which the system will take care of displaying the border\n * in the correct position, or to not display the border by setting\n * `underlineColorAndroid` to transparent.\n *\n * Note that on Android performing text selection in input can change\n * app's activity `windowSoftInputMode` param to `adjustResize`.\n * This may cause issues with components that have position: 'absolute'\n * while keyboard is active. To avoid this behavior either specify `windowSoftInputMode`\n * in AndroidManifest.xml ( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html )\n * or control this param programmatically with native code.\n *\n */\n\nconst TextInput = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'TextInput',\n  statics: {\n    /* TODO(brentvatne) docs are needed for this */\n    State: TextInputState,\n  },\n\n  propTypes: {\n    ...ViewPropTypes,\n    /**\n     * Can tell `TextInput` to automatically capitalize certain characters.\n     *\n     * - `characters`: all characters.\n     * - `words`: first letter of each word.\n     * - `sentences`: first letter of each sentence (*default*).\n     * - `none`: don't auto capitalize anything.\n     */\n    autoCapitalize: PropTypes.oneOf([\n      'none',\n      'sentences',\n      'words',\n      'characters',\n    ]),\n    /**\n     * If `false`, disables auto-correct.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *

The \"right thing\" is very\n   * nuanced. When moving two touches in opposite directions, the cumulative\n   * distance is zero in each dimension. When two touches move in parallel five\n   * pixels in the same direction, the cumulative distance is five, not ten. If\n   * two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other\n   * touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.\n   *\n   * This logic requires a kind of processing of time \"clusters\" of touch events\n   * so that two touch moves that essentially occur in parallel but move every\n   * other frame respectively, are considered part of the same movement.\n   *\n   * Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:\n   *\n   * - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is\n   *   invalid. If a move event has been observed, `(moveX, moveY)` is the\n   *   centroid of the most recently moved \"cluster\" of active touches.\n   *   (Currently all move have the same timeStamp, but later we should add some\n   *   threshold for what is considered to be \"moving\"). If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance. Accounts for touch moves that are clustered together in time,\n   *   moving the same direction.

It is incorrect to continuously take all\n   * active *and* recently moved touches, find the centroid, and track how that\n   * result changes over time. Instead, we must take all recently moved\n   * touches, and calculate how the centroid has changed just for those\n   * recently moved touches, and append that change to an accumulator. This is\n   * to (at least) handle the case where the user is moving three fingers, and\n   * then one of the fingers stops but the other two continue.\n   *\n   * This is very different than taking all of the recently moved touches and\n   * storing their centroid as `dx/dy`. For correctness, we must *accumulate\n   * changes* in the centroid of recently moved touches.\n   *\n   * There is also some nuance with how we handle multiple moved touches in a\n   * single event. With the way `ReactNativeEventEmitter` dispatches touches as\n   * individual events, multiple touches generate two 'move' events, each of\n   * them triggering `onResponderMove`. But with the way `PanResponder` works,\n   * all of the gesture inference is performed on the first dispatch, since it\n   * looks at all of the touches (even the ones for which there hasn't been a\n   * native dispatch yet). Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch. This diverges from the\n   * typical responder callback pattern (without using `PanResponder`), but\n   * avoids more dispatches than necessary.\n   */\n  _updateGestureStateOnMove: function (gestureState, touchHistory) {\n    gestureState.numberActiveTouches = touchHistory.numberActiveTouches;\n    gestureState.moveX = currentCentroidXOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, gestureState._accountsForMovesUpTo);\n    gestureState.moveY = currentCentroidYOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, gestureState._accountsForMovesUpTo);\n    const movedAfter = gestureState._accountsForMovesUpTo;\n    const prevX = previousCentroidXOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, movedAfter);\n    const x = currentCentroidXOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, movedAfter);\n    const prevY = previousCentroidYOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, movedAfter);\n    const y = currentCentroidYOfTouchesChangedAfter(touchHistory, movedAfter);\n    const nextDX = gestureState.dx + (x - prevX);\n    const nextDY = gestureState.dy + (y - prevY);\n\n    // TODO: This must be filtered intelligently.\n    const dt = touchHistory.mostRecentTimeStamp - gestureState._accountsForMovesUpTo;\n    gestureState.vx = (nextDX - gestureState.dx) / dt;\n    gestureState.vy = (nextDY - gestureState.dy) / dt;\n\n    gestureState.dx = nextDX;\n    gestureState.dy = nextDY;\n    gestureState._accountsForMovesUpTo = touchHistory.mostRecentTimeStamp;\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * @param {object} config Enhanced versions of all of the responder callbacks\n   * that provide not only the typical `ResponderSyntheticEvent`, but also the\n   * `PanResponder` gesture state.

Check out this\n * [blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html)\n * for more details.\n *\n * ListView - A core component designed for efficient display of vertically\n * scrolling lists of changing data. The minimal API is to create a\n * [`ListView.DataSource`](docs/listviewdatasource.html), populate it with a simple\n * array of data blobs, and instantiate a `ListView` component with that data\n * source and a `renderRow` callback which takes a blob from the data array and\n * returns a renderable component.\n *\n * Minimal example:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyComponent extends Component {\n *   constructor() {\n *     super();\n *     const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n *     this.state = {\n *       dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <ListView\n *         dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n *         renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\n * section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\n * the available data (`onEndReached`) and on the set of rows that are visible\n * in the device viewport change (`onChangeVisibleRows`), and several\n * performance optimizations.\n *\n * There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\n * smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\n * infinite) data sets:\n *\n *  * Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\n *    data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\n *    source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.\n *\n *  * Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\n *    event-loop (customizable with the `pageSize` prop). This breaks up the\n *    work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\n *    rendering rows.\n */\n\nvar ListView = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'ListView',\n  _childFrames: ([]: Array<Object>),\n  _sentEndForContentLength: (null: ?number),\n  _scrollComponent: (null: any),\n  _prevRenderedRowsCount: 0,\n  _visibleRows: ({}: Object),\n  scrollProperties: ({}: Object),\n\n  mixins: [ScrollResponder.Mixin, TimerMixin],\n\n  statics: {\n    DataSource: ListViewDataSource,\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * You must provide a renderRow function.

In general, this should only really be used if you need more flexibility than\n * `FlatList` provides, e.g. for use with immutable data instead of plain arrays.\n *\n * Virtualization massively improves memory consumption and performance of large lists by\n * maintaining a finite render window of active items and replacing all items outside of the render\n * window with appropriately sized blank space. The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\n * are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\n * visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.\n *\n * Some caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nclass VirtualizedList extends React.PureComponent<Props, State> {\n  props: Props;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  scrollToEnd(params?: ?{animated?: ?boolean}) {\n    const animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    const veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n    const frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n    const offset = Math.max(\n      0,\n      frame.offset +\n        frame.length +\n        this._footerLength -\n        this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength,\n    );\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

The title and body will stack on top of each other on\n * account of the literal newlines:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class TextInANest extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       titleText: \"Bird's Nest\",\n *       bodyText: 'This is not really a bird nest.'\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <Text style={styles.baseText}>\n *         <Text style={styles.titleText} onPress={this.onPressTitle}>\n *           {this.state.titleText}{'\\n'}{'\\n'}\n *         </Text>\n *         <Text numberOfLines={5}>\n *           {this.state.bodyText}\n *         </Text>\n *       </Text>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n *   baseText: {\n *     fontFamily: 'Cochin',\n *   },\n *   titleText: {\n *     fontSize: 20,\n *     fontWeight: 'bold',\n *   },\n * });\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('TextInANest', () => TextInANest);\n * ```\n *\n * ## Nested text\n *\n * Both iOS and Android allow you to display formatted text by annotating\n * ranges of a string with specific formatting like bold or colored text\n * (`NSAttributedString` on iOS, `SpannableString` on Android). In practice,\n * this is very tedious. For React Native, we decided to use web paradigm for\n * this where you can nest text to achieve the same effect.\n *\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class BoldAndBeautiful extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n *         I am bold\n *         <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>\n *           and red\n *         </Text>\n *       </Text>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => BoldAndBeautiful);\n * ```\n *\n * Behind the scenes, React Native converts this to a flat `NSAttributedString`\n * or `SpannableString` that contains the following information:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * \"I am bold and red\"\n * 0-9: bold\n * 9-17: bold, red\n * ```\n *\n * ## Nested views (iOS only)\n *\n * On iOS, you can nest views within your Text component. Here's an example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class BlueIsCool extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <Text>\n *         There is a blue square\n *         <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />\n *         in between my text.\n *       </Text>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => BlueIsCool);\n * ```\n *\n * > In order to use this feature, you must give the view a `width` and a `height`.\n *\n * ## Containers\n *\n * The `<Text>` element is special relative to layout: everything inside is no\n * longer using the flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that\n * elements inside of a `<Text>` are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they\n * see the end of the line.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * <Text>\n *   <Text>First part and </Text>\n *   <Text>second part</Text>\n * </Text>\n * // Text container: all the text flows as if it was one\n * // |First part |\n * // |and second |\n * // |part       |\n *\n * <View>\n *   <Text>First part and </Text>\n *   <Text>second part</Text>\n * </View>\n * // View container: each text is its own block\n * // |First part |\n * // |and        |\n * // |second part|\n * ```\n *\n * ## Limited Style Inheritance\n *\n * On the web, the usual way to set a font family and size for the entire\n * document is to take advantage of inherited CSS properties like so:\n *\n * ```css\n * html {\n *   font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;\n *   font-size: 11px;\n *   color: #141823;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * All elements in the document will inherit this font unless they or one of\n * their parents specifies a new rule.\n *\n * In React Native, we are more strict about it: **you must wrap all the text\n * nodes inside of a `<Text>` component**. You cannot have a text node directly\n * under a `<View>`.\n *\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a <View>\n * <View>\n *   Some text\n * </View>\n *\n * // GOOD\n * <View>\n *   <Text>\n *     Some text\n *   </Text>\n * </View>\n * ```\n *\n * You also lose the ability to set up a default font for an entire subtree.\n * The recommended way to use consistent fonts and sizes across your\n * application is to create a component `MyAppText` that includes them and use\n * this component across your app. You can also use this component to make more\n * specific components like `MyAppHeaderText` for other kinds of text.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * <View>\n *   <MyAppText>Text styled with the default font for the entire application</MyAppText>\n *   <MyAppHeaderText>Text styled as a header</MyAppHeaderText>\n * </View>\n * ```\n *\n * Assuming that `MyAppText` is a component that simply renders out its\n * children into a `Text` component with styling, then `MyAppHeaderText` can be\n * defined as follows:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * class MyAppHeaderText extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <MyAppText>\n *         <Text style={{fontSize: 20}}>\n *           {this.props.children}\n *         </Text>\n *       </MyAppText>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Composing `MyAppText` in this way ensures that we get the styles from a\n * top-level component, but leaves us the ability to add / override them in\n * specific use cases.\n *\n * React Native still has the concept of style inheritance, but limited to text\n * subtrees. In this case, the second part will be both bold and red.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * <Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n *   I am bold\n *   <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>\n *     and red\n *   </Text>\n * </Text>\n * ```\n *\n * We believe that this more constrained way to style text will yield better\n * apps:\n *\n * - (Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind:\n * You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application,\n * trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the\n * same way.

But, ultimately the physical display only\n * have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iPhone 4 or 750×1334\n * for iPhone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by\n * spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The\n * downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look\n * blurry.\n *\n * In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they\n * have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having\n * blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels\n * automatically.\n *\n * We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with\n * rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate\n * rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one\n * pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.\n *\n * In React Native, everything in JavaScript and within the layout engine works\n * with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and\n * dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also,\n * rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid\n * accumulating rounding errors.\n *\n */\nclass PixelRatio {\n  /**\n   * Returns the device pixel density.
